# Fire Simulation Improvements

## Overview

Enhanced the wildfire simulation in `Calculations.jsx` to provide more realistic fire visualization and recovery patterns.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Active Fire Visualization

- **Added `activeFire` state**: Tracks currently burning cells separately from burned cells
- **Fire colors during spreading**: Cells now show red/orange colors while actively burning
- **Proper fire progression**: Visual distinction between actively burning cells and already burned areas

### 2. Realistic Recovery System

- **Individual cell recovery data**: Each burned cell has unique recovery parameters
- **Terrain-based recovery rates**: Different recovery speeds based on terrain type:
  - **Forest**: Slower recovery (60% duration, starts at 20% progress)
  - **Grassland**: Faster recovery (30% duration, starts at 5% progress)
  - **Shrubland**: Medium recovery (40% duration, starts at 10% progress)
  - **Barren**: Very slow recovery (80% duration, starts at 40% progress)

### 3. Permanent Damage System

- **Realistic damage persistence**: Some cells may never fully recover
- **Terrain-specific permanent damage rates**:
  - Barren land: 30% chance of permanent damage
  - Forest: 15% chance of permanent damage
  - Other terrain: 5% chance of permanent damage

### 4. Gradual Recovery Animation

- **Staggered recovery timing**: Cells start recovering at different times
- **Variable recovery duration**: Each cell recovers at its own pace
- **Randomization factors**: Â±50% variation in recovery rates for realism

## Technical Implementation

### New State Variables

```javascript
const [activeFire, setActiveFire] = useState(new Set()); // Currently burning cells
const [cellRecoveryData, setCellRecoveryData] = useState(new Map()); // Cell-specific recovery info
```

### Enhanced Drawing Logic

- Fire colors shown during `FIRE_SPREADING` state
- Individual cell recovery progress during `RECOVERING` state
- Proper color interpolation from burned to unburned based on cell-specific timing

### Recovery Data Structure

```javascript
recoveryMap.set(cellKey, {
  startProgress: 0.2, // When recovery begins (0-1 scale)
  duration: 0.6, // How long recovery takes (0-1 scale)
});
```

## Visual Improvements

1. **Fire Spreading**: Red/orange colors show active burning
2. **Recovery Phase**: Gradual color transition from burned (dark) to recovered (green)
3. **Permanent Damage**: Some cells remain permanently burned (realistic scarring)
4. **Terrain Awareness**: Different recovery patterns for different land types

## User Experience

- More engaging fire visualization with proper fire colors
- Realistic recovery that doesn't happen all at once
- Educational value showing how different terrains recover differently
- Permanent damage zones that demonstrate long-term fire impact

## Testing

The improvements can be tested by:

1. Running a fire simulation
2. Observing red/orange colors during fire spread
3. Watching the gradual, varied recovery patterns
4. Noting that some areas remain permanently damaged

This creates a much more realistic and educational fire simulation experience.
